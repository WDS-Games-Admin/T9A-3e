    "Type": "General",
    "Description": "There are three different Move Manoeuvres. When a unit moves in the Movement Phase, it must select which Move Manoeuvres it will perform:\n-   Advance Move, \n-   March Move, or\n-   Reform Move.\nRemember that since you are allowed to perform any measurements at any time, it's possible to test a Move Manoeuvre, realise it was not a great idea, and then immediately backtrack and perform a different Move Manoeuvre, unless random events or decisions by the opponent has happened that could influence the decision. It is also customary to mark the starting position, so that backtracking is possible to do accurately.\n\nReform Moves is where a unit tactically adjusts their arrangement on the field, granting them the strategic edge to adapt to new challenges during battle. This controlled shift is used to optimise positioning, formation and facing, white staying mostly in the same spot. \\\nAdvance Moves provide units with the freedom to manoeuvre on the battlefield, making it a versatile choice for repositioning when preparing to engage with the enemy.\\\nMarch Moves are the fastest but least flexible movement option available to a unit. It allows the unit to move quickly in a forward direction.\nValid Final Position\nFor the final position of the unit to be considered a valid position, regardless of which Move Manoeuvre was performed, the following condition must be met. If not, the Move Manoeuvre cannot be performed.\n-   Each corner of the unit’s end position must be within twice its Mobility value (2xMob inches) of at least one corner’s starting position. Note that a  corner need  not be within 2xMob inches of the same corner's starting position.\nFor simplicity, measure the corner that is furthest away from the starting position, and measure towards the starting position of the closest corner.\n\n\nReferenceManualColorExample of how to measure Valid Final PositionThe unit moves forward and wheels to face right. When reaching the end position, make sure that the corner that travelled furthest is still within 2xMob of at least one of the corners of the unit's starting position (marked in red dashed line in the figure).\n\n\nAdvance Move\nWhen performing an Advance Move, execute the following actions in the order given below:\n1 -  Pivot: The Advance Move is initiated with a Pivot. At the end of this pivot, the unit must follow the Unit Spacing rule (note that since this is partway through a move, the unit may normally be up to within 0.5\" from other units).\n2 -  Snaking Forward Move (Mob): After the Pivot, the unit may do  any number of Snaking Forward Moves, with a distance no more than equal to its Mobility (in inches). While performing these Snaking Forward Moves, the direction the unit is facing must stay within 90 degrees (in either direction) from the direction the unit was facing after the Pivot.\n3 -  Reorder: Models may be repositioned within the unit, as long as the number of files does not change.\nMarch Move\nWhen performing a March Move, execute the following actions in the order given below:\n1 -  Snaking Forward Move (2xMob): The unit may do any number of Snaking Forward Moves, with a total distance no more than equal to twice its Mobility (in inches). While performing these Snaking Forward Moves, the direction the unit is facing must stay within 90 degrees (in either direction) from the direction the unit was facing before the March Move.\\\n2 -  Reorder: Models may be repositioned within the unit, as long as the number of files does not change. \\\nReform Move\nTo do a Reform Move, pick the unit up from the battlefield and put it back with the following restrictions:\n-   The centre of the unit can not travel further than half the unit's Mobility (see Characteristic Profiles in the Definitions and Terminology chapter).\n-   The formation of the unit may change only as long as the number of Files has not changed by more than 2 . Remember that the unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank (see Models and Units in the Definitions and Terminology chapter).\n-   Each model is considered to have moved from its starting position to end position, around obstructions where needed, and no single model can move further than twice its Mobility.\nWhen measuring each model's move, it is considered to move independently of its unit, in any direction or combination of directions, including side- and back-stepping. The models can ignore other models from the same unit, but not from other units. No single model can move further than twice its Mobility. Measure the centre of each model's base, and measure the path the model moves on the Battlefield, from starting to ending position, including the path winding around obstacles.\nTreat each model as an individual unit following the Unit Spacing rule. At the end of this move, all models come back together again into a viable formation as described above.\nReferenceManualColorSimplified Reform Move\\\nIn practice, for the vast majority of Reform and Advance Moves, there is no  need to consider the movements of individual models.\\\nThe Upper example shows the technical way to perform a Reform Move; moving models one by one (grey dotted lines), and measuring distance the centre moved (black dotted line). \\\nThe Lower image show a simplified method to perform a Reform Move: Move the unit as a whole, potentially readjusting formation by adding or removing files. Measure the distance the centre travels, while making sure that no model moves further than its Mobility * 2, typically by measuring the distance of the models that have travelled the furthest.\\\nReferenceManualColorExample of Reform Move\nMid-Reform Move Actions\nIf, for any reasons, a model's position is relevant during a mid-Reform Move, such as during a Sweeping Attack or Dangerous Terrain Tests, the unit must be placed in a viable formation and following the Unit Spacing rule (0.5\") at the point where it becomes relevant, before continuing the move. If it cannot be placed, the move cannot be performed. When measuring the distance each model moves, measure from starting position, to the position it is placed mid-move, and then finally to its ending position."

If the total is equal to or above the Casting Roll, the dispel is successful, proceed to step 7. Otherwise, the Dispelling Roll failed, proceed to step 6.\n-   Fizzle: If one or more ‘1’ was rolled,  and the Dispelling Roll was not successful, each dice that rolled a ‘1’ is added back to the Magic Dice pool.\n1012Resolving the spell effect\n6 -  Apply spell Effects: If the Casting Roll was successful, and the spell was not not dispelled, it is successfully cast. Apply the spell Effects.\nSpell effects are never affected by any effects affecting the Caster, including Magic Items, Model Rules, other Spell effects, or similar abilities, unless specifically stated otherwise.\n7 -  Next Casting: Afterward, the Active Player may attempt to cast other spells, provided there are enough Magic Dice left.\nCasting Multiple Instances of the same Spell\nEach Caster can only try to cast each of its Learned Spells once per Magic Phase, and it may try to cast a Bound Spell once for each time it has it. If multiple Casters knows the same Spell, all of them may try to cast their instance(s) of the Spell.\nWhen making an attempt to cast a Learned Spell where a version of the same spell (either Bound or Learned) has already been attempted (successfully or not), then the Casting Roll reduced by 3. This is reduced by another 3 for each additional attempt in the same phase. For example, if 2 instances of a spell have been attempted, the Casting Roll is reduced by 6.\nIf instead attempting to cast a Bound Spell, the Casting Roll is only reduced by 1, instead of by 3, for each time a version of the same spell has already been tried.\nRemember that Replicable Spells ignore this modifier but still count as a casting.\nBound Spells\nCasting and Dispelling Bound Spells follow the normal procedure for Casting a Learned Spell, with the following exceptions:\n-   When trying to cast a Bound Spell one Magic Die is a D6, the rest are D3. For example, if Casting a Bound Spell with 3 Magic Dice, roll 1D6 and 2D3.\n-   A rolled D3 can never fizzle.\n-   Bound Spells have their own Casting Values, defined in the brackets following Bound Spell.\n-   Bound Spells can never Miscast.\nWhen Casting a Bound Spell version of a Learned Spell that was already cast in the same Magic Phase, the Casting Roll is decreased only by 1 (instead of by 3).\nNote: When Casting a Learned Spell version of a Bound Spell that was already cast in the same Magic Phase, the Casting Roll is decreased by 3, as usual.  This is ignored if the Bound Spell is Replicable.\nBound Spells are designed to offer low-resource and low-risk casting opportunities to the players. They typically require fewer dice for casting and never cause Miscasts. However, they are also easier to dispel. As a result, Bound Spells are the perfect tool when the opponent is out of Magic Dice for dispelling.\nWhen casting Bound Spells, it is important to clearly differentiate between the D6 and D3 dice. Announce to the opponent how you roll your dice, and either roll them separately, use differently coloured dice, or use dedicated D3-only dice."

Legal Position?\nAt the end of the Pursue Move, check if the unit is in a legal position following the <u><link=\"unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</link></u> rule. It cannot be in contact with an enemy unit it did not declare a Charge against, but can be within 0.5\" of units and <u><link=\"impassable_terrain\">Impassable Terrain</link></u> , this  includes friendly units that were part of the same Combat.

The owner of the winning units chooses to roll for unit A’s Pursuit Distance first. 6\" is not enough to catch the Fleeing unit. Unit B’s Pursuit Distance is 7\", so it is equal to or higher than unit D’s Flee Distance: the Fleeing unit is immediately  <u><link=\"removed\">removed</link></u> as a casualty. Unit C's Pursuit Distance is 5\".\\\\\nb) When checking which units will Charge an enemy unit during their Pursuit, before moving any Pursuing unit, it turns out that both unit A and unit B will Charge unit E, so both units declare a Charge against unit E. Unit C will not Charge any enemy units. \\\\\nc) Now units A and B perform their Pursuit Moves first. During this move, they can move through one another ignoring the <u><link=\"unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</link></u> rule. Otherwise, they move using the normal rules for <u><link=\"charge_moves\">Charge Moves</link></u> (one Wheel allowed, Maximising Contact). In order to maximise the number of <u><link=\"model\">models</link></u> and units in base contact, unit A aligns its Front Facing with unit E’s, while unit B moves into corner to corner contact with unit E.

However, a natural roll of ‘1’ is considered a failure.\nArm - AP    Armour Save Roll\n5 or above    2+\n4    3+\n3    4+\n2    5+\n1    6+\n0    Cannot be passed  \nAP 0    AP 1    AP 2    AP 3    AP 4    AP 5    AP 6\nArm 0    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 1    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 2    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 3    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 4    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 5    2+    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A\nArm 6    2+    2+    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A  \nFor example, Armour 3, means that ‘6’, ‘5’, and ‘4’ would be successful Armour Save rolls. If the model is attacked by Armour Penetration 1, its Armour is reduced to Armour 2, which now means that ‘6’ and ‘5’ are successful Armour Save rolls. \nThis is equivalent with using the formula below to determine the required roll to negate the wound:\n7 - (Defender’s Armor)\n+ (Attacker’s Armour Penetration)\nCombined Armour\nEach model has a base Armour value in its profile, and some models may have additional equipment, rules, or are under the effect of spells that modify the Armour values. Different sources of Armour can be combined, adding up to the total combined Armour.\nFor example, a model with a base Armour of 3 that is under the effect of a spell that grants +1 Armour, has a combined Armour of 4. When wounded by an attack with Armour Penetration 1, the Armour Save roll would be ‘4’, ‘5’, or ‘6’ (or 4+).\nSpecial Saves\nIf a wound is not saved by the Armour Save, the defender may negate the attack with its Special Save, if it has one. Special Saves work like Armour saves, except they are unaffected by Armour Penetration.\nA natural roll of ‘1’ or ‘2’ is always considered a failure.\nThere are two main types of Special Saves; Aegis and Regeneration, each explained in more detail in the  Model Rules section. A model is only allowed to roll one Special Save roll for each attack."

Each unit that declared a Charge in this phase, now rolls its Charge Range and, if successful, performs a Charge Move. Roll and move units one by one.\n\nCharge Range\nRoll D6+4 and add the unit's Charge Speed (see Characteristic Profiles in the Definitions and Terminology chapter).\n-   If the Charge Range is equal to or greater than the distance between the Charging unit and its intended target (in inches), there is enough space to complete the Charge Move including the Align Move, the Charge is successful and the Charging unit performs a Charge Move.\n-   Otherwise, the Charge has failed and the Charging Unit performs a Failed Charge Move.\nFront or Flank?a) The Charging unit B is Located in enemy A's Front Arc (since this is where the centre of its Front Facing is).\\\nb) The Charging unit must contact the charged unit's Front Facing.\nSome players prefer to know their odds when declaring charges.\\\nBelow are the probabilities for the most common charges.\nNeeded score to & 5\" & 6\" & 7\" & 8\" & 9\" & 10\"\nD6+4 & 100% & 83% & 67% & 50% & 33% & 17%\nMaximised*D6+4 & 100% & 97% & 89% & 75% & 56% & 31%\n*Maximised rolls are explained in the Definitions and Terminiology chapter.\nCharge Move\nA Charge Move is divided into two moves, first a Snaking Forward Move to get into contact with the target unit, which is then followed by an Align Move.\nStart with establishing in what Arc of the target unit, that the centre of the Charging Unit’s Front Facing is located in (see figure above). The Facing that corresponds to this Arc is the Target Facing. See Definitions and Terminology chapter for definitions of Arcs and Facings.\nA Charge Move is then resolved using a single Snaking Forward Move (see Movement Phase chapter for details), with an unlimited distance. During this move, the Charging Unit must move contact with its intended target - The Charging Unit’s Front Facing against the Target Facing.\nCharge Moves are allowed to end the move within 1\" of Impassable Terrain or other units, but are not allowed to move into contact with any enemy unit, other than the target of the Charge.\nOnce the Charging Unit touches its Target Facing, it performs an Align Move. This is done by picking up the Charging Unit and placing it back on the board aligned with the target unit, in a way that keeps the initial point of contact on the charged unit still in contact, while maximising the number of models in contact. See the Reference Handbook for details on how to prioritise the Align Move in complex situations.\nApply the rules below when performing Align Moves. The Charge Move must be made in such a way that the Charging Unit can satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n-   The initial point of contact* on the target unit, before the Align Move, must remain in contact* after the Align Move. Note that the charging model that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact*.\n-   If there is no single initial point of contact*, e.g. because the initial contact*is made along a line, the owner of the Charging Unit declares where the initial point of contact* is, among the possible points of initial contact*. This choice must be made such that the conditions below are satisfied as best as possible.\n-   The Charging Unit is placed fully aligned with its Front Facing flush against the Target Facing.\n-   If this is not possible, apply the rules for Unaligned Charges (see below).\n-   The number of models in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\n-   The number of models in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\nIf it is unavoidable to break one or more of the above conditions, prioritise maintaining the higher priority conditions, even if it means breaking a greater number of conditions in total. The Charging Unit must, if able to, perform its Charge Move so that the models involved in the initial contact* satisfies the conditions above as best as possible. As long as all the above conditions are satisfied to the best extent possible, the owner has the freedom to choose how to perform the Align Move.\nReferenceManualColorExample of a Charge Move.

But if the hound creeps up one way, and Klepa sidles over from behind, I can often have a leeesurely peroosal of pockets and purses before they know a thing. Teamwork makes the dream work – or as we Warborn say, broodwork makes the mood work!\nUnaligned Charges\nIf the Charging Unit cannot perform an Align Move to where it is both fully aligned with the enemy and the initial point of contact* remains in contact (Align Move conditions 1 and 2), apply the following rules instead.The Charge Move and Align Move(s) for Unaligned Charges must be made in such a way that the initial point of contact on the target unit, before the initial Align Move, must remain in contact after the initial Align Move, and at the end of both Align Moves, the Front Facing does not pass over the projected line that runs parallel with the Target Facing.\nThis is marked in red in figure 2, step 1.\nAfter making sure that the Charge will be possible without breaking above condition, the Charging Unit must satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n-   The initial point of contact on the target unit, before the initial Align Move, must remain in contact* after the initial Align Move.\nNote that the charging model that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact.\n-   Minimise the angle between the Front Facing of the Charging Unit and the Target Facing.\n-   The number of models in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised.\n-   The number of models in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised.\n*Contact here is referring to Base Contact between Unit Boundaries, including Fighting Over Gaps.\nAfter performing the initial Align Move, the target unit performs a special Align Move. It is picked up and rotated around the point of contact, such that the angle between the Charging Unit's Front Facing and the Target Facing is further minimised, possibly bringing the units into being fully aligned.\nNote: Any units not fully aligned must attempt to Combat Reform whenever possible. See Melee chapter for details.\nCombined Charges\nWhen more than one unit has declared a Charge against the same enemy unit, Chargers are moved in a slightly different order.\n-   Roll Charge Range for each unit Charging that same target before moving any of them.\n-   Decide the order that the units will be moved, both Charge Moves and failed Charge Moves. This order must be chosen so that the number of units that successfully completes a charge is as high as possible.\n-   Move the units, one by one, following the normal Charge Move rules with the following exceptions:\n-   Never apply the rules for Unaligned Charges or Blocked Path. If it is not possible to place the Charging Unit fully aligned with the enemy, the charge is considered impossible.\n-   Each individual unit is not required to maximize the number of models in contact (conditions 4 and 5). Instead, apply these conditions at the end of all Charge Moves. This means that the total number of models from both sides are maximized after all successful charges have been performed.\n-   In situations where not all the charging units can complete the Charge Move, e.g. due to other units blocking the path, such units will perform a Failed Charge move instead.\n\nBlocked Path\nTo prevent abusive situations where a unit cannot Charge a nearby enemy unit due to a convoluted positioning of enemy units the following rules are applied.\nBlocked Path can be applied against enemy units that fulfill all of the following criteria:\n-   The enemy unit is directly in front of your unit. This means that the first obstacle (other unit or Impassable Terrain) that a straight forward move of your unit would hit is the enemy unit, and\n-   Your unit would be unable to perform a Charge Move to get into contact with the Target Facing of the enemy unit.\n-   The Charge is not made impossible due to friendly units Engaged with the Target Facing of the enemy unit (i.e. Blocked Path is not applicable if the Charge is made impossible due to your own units being Engaged with the Target Facing\nIn this situation, your unit may Declare a Charge against the enemy unit, and if the enemy does not Flee,  use the Facing that is adjecent to the Target Facing and closest to the Charging Unit (and perform a Charge Move as normal against this chosen Target Facing)."

These situations include:\n-   A friendly Shaken unit performs a Flee Move through the unit.\n-   A Flee Move that is the direct consequence of a voluntary decision does not cause a Panic Test to friendly units.\nThis includes Charge Reaction Flee! (unless caused by a failed Panic Test when charged by a model containing Terror), and voluntary Breaking from Combat with a unit entirely with Feigned Flight. Note that a Flee Move due to a failed Rally Test is not considered a voluntary Flee Move, even if originally due to a Charge Reaction Flee!.\n-   Take the test after completing the Flee Move.\n-   The unit suffered enough Health Point losses in a single phase from Ranged Attacks originating from enemy models, to fulfill both of the following criteria:\n-   At least 3 Health Points losses, and\n-   At least an amount of Health Points losses to equal 25% of the number of HP the unit has at the start of the Phase.\nTake the Panic Test immediately after possible casualties have been removed. Ignore Health Point losses suffered while Engaged in Combat.\n-   An enemy unit entirely with Terror declares a Charge against the unit in the Charge Phase.\nUnits do not take Panic Tests if\n-   they are Engaged in Combat, or\n-   they are already Shaken, or\n-   they already passed a Panic Test during this phase.\nIf a unit fails a Panic test, it immediately becomes Shaken.\nNote that this normally does not mean the unit performs a Flee Move."

Naturally I had to write a treatise in response – the Flux is simply the vulgar term for the flow of magic into and around our Realm, and all proper experiments demonstrate that though a wizard might draw more of this substance to themselves by “channelling”, they cannot increase the total magical resources in the vicinity, which is entirely random.

Melee Weapons are used with the model part’s Standard Melee Attacks.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  •  Modifiers to Offensive Characteristics and Attack Attributes are applied only to the model part’s Standard Melee Attacks.\n\t\t\t\t\n  •  Modifiers to Global or Defensive Characteristics (Mob, Cha, Cou, Def, HP, Res, or Arm), and Model Rules that are not Attack Attributes, are applied to the model or model part (see rules for Character Mounts for details when and how Characteristics of mounts are affected) at all times except while using a different Melee Weapon.\n\t\t\t\t\n  •  Variable bonuses, such as those based on a dice roll, are determined at the start of the Agility Step in which the weapon is used.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n  •  Shooting Weapon: Shooting Weapons are used for making Shooting Attacks. Each model part can only use one Shooting Weapon per phase. A Shooting Weapon typically has an Aim Value, shown in brackets after the name of the weapon. The rules for the Shooting Weapon will define the weapon’s maximum Range, the number of Shots fired, and the Strength, Armour Penetration, and potentially Attack Attributes applied to its attacks."

    "Id": "rulebook-keywords",
    "Name": "Keywords",
    "Type": "General",
    "Description": "Model Rules include keywords to help define their effects. These keywords can be used directly within the rulebook, which applies to rules that always have that keyword. Alternatively, keywords can be specified for individual rules on specific models, spells, or weapons. In this case this is done within brackets following the name of the rule.\n\n\tBelow follows a list of Model Rule keywords:\n\t\n\t\t\n  •  Shooting or Melee & Shooting (Attack Attributes only): An Attack Attribute with the keyword Shooting only affects attacks made with Shooting Weapons, while an Attack Attribute with the keyword Melee & Shooting affects both Melee Attacks and attacks made with Shooting Weapons.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  •  Remember that the default if none of these keywords are used is that Attack Attributes only affect Melee Attacks.\n\t\t\t\n  •  For example, by default Poison Attacks affect only Melee Attacks. If a model part has Poison Attacks(Shooting), this means the Poison Attacks rule applies only to attacks made with that model part’s Shooting Weapons, unless it also has Poison Attacks or Poison Attacks(Melee & Shooting).\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n  •  Special Attacks: Apply the following rules to Attack Attributes with this keyword. A model with this rule can make a special Melee Attack (which is not a Standard Melee Attack), that hits automatically. Since not a Standard Melee Attack this attack can usually not be made as a Supporting Attack and does not suffer from Restricted Attacks (see Melee chapter). Special Attacks cannot be allocated towards Attachable Models that could not be the target of a Ranged Attack (see Attacks chapter).\n\t\t\n  •  Cumulative: Effects from multiple instances of a Model Rule with the Cumulative keyword are combined and add up.\n\t\t\n  •  Distance Modifiers: Denoted as a number followed by \". Any distances in the Model Rule description is replaced by the number. For example, Vanguard(3\"\") means that the model can perform a Vanguard move, but its Mobility is set to 3\" instead of the normal 6\".\n\t\t\n  •  Towards X: The Attack Attribute only applies if the attack is allocated to a specific type of enemy model. The conditions are given as X. If more than one type of enemy is relevant they are separated by or. If multiple conditions must be fulfilled, these conditions are separated by and.\tFor example, Multiple Wounds(2, towards Height 4 and Beast, or Height 5) means that Multiple Wounds can be used versus models that are both Height 4 and Beast, as well as versus models that are Height 5, regardless of if the model has the Beast Property or not.\n\t\t\n  •  Against X: The Model Rule only applies when attacked by a certain type of model or with certain Rules or Properties. See the rules under Towards X for how to interpret or and and. For example, Hard Target(against Lethal Strike) means that the model can only use its Hard Target rule when attacked by an attack with Lethal Strike.\n\t\t\n  •  Unique Keywords: In addition to the standard model rule keywords defined above, certain Model Rules have unique keywords. These are defined in the respective rules themselves."

    "Description": "Welcome to the tabletop wargame known as The 9th Age: Fantasy Battles, or T9A for short. This is a community crafted miniatures wargame, where grand armies collide in monumental conflicts for supremacy and survival. The game is played on a tabletop with terrain features and miniatures to represent the battlefield and the clashing armies, and it uses six-sided dice and measuring devices to move miniatures and resolve actions such as charging into battle, letting arrows loose, and casting spells.\n\nFor all the rules, feedback, and suggestions, please visit our webpage: the-ninth-age.com. The rules presented in this book are considered the Core Rules of T9A and are used in all T9A games. \\\nLicence: Copyright Creative Commons\n\nRules representation\n\nIn order to keep rules clear and tidy, the following text formatting is used:\n\nText in a grey box denotes designer notes. In these are the designers giving some insights into intent behind rules, alternate ways to play the game, or shortcuts to speed things up.\n\n  •  Capitalization is used for words/phrases that are defined in this book, such as Round of Combat, unless they are common words with no elaborate game definition like model or unit, but Combat is since it is not used like the common British term.\n\n  •  Bold font or text is used to highlight specific words. It is also used in Army Books to emphasise Model Rules specified in the same unit entry.\n\n  •  Italic font marks reminders, examples, clarifications, and other content that are not direct rules.\n\n  •  Grey-coloured text is used for figure and table captions, item restrictions, repetitive content, and Properties, which is a special type of keyword that doesn’t transfer any direct rules.\n\n  •  Hyperlinks can be found in the electronic version of this document, and the page footer includes hyperlinks to key sections.\n\n  •  Pink text is unique to  the Reference Handbook . This Handbook covers corner-cases and specific circumstances that are not expected to be relevant in the majority of games. The Handbook is a copy of the Illustrated Rulebook with additional sections added to cover these corner-cases.\n\nRules Documents\n\nIllustrated Rulebook\nThe Illustrated Rulebook contains a streamlined version of the main rules needed for playing the game, alongside art, miniature images and lore.\nAppendices\nAppendices are an integral component of the core rules, and are generally used in most games. There are two appendices to the Illustrated Rulebook:\n\n  •  Illustrated Rulebook - Appendix I: Model Rules -- Additional and unique rules that specific models possess.\n\n  •  Illustrated Rulebook - Appendix II: Arcane Compendium -- The compendium contains spells from the ten different paths of magic, along with the common Magic Items.\n\nSeason Packs\nThese documents comprise additional Deployment Types, maps, and Secondary Objectives, catering towards more advanced games.\n\nReference Handbook\nThis handbook includes all rules from the Illustrated Rulebook, plus Appendix I: Model Rules and Appendix II: Arcane Compendium documents. Additionally, it includes extended rules text to cover for intricate and complex battlefield situations. We recommend that players who prefer to understand complex situations in advance and fully grasp the nuances of all rule interactions, to turn directly to this document.\n\n\tFor new players and those who prefer to deal with intricate scenarios as they arise, we suggest starting with the Illustrated Rulebook and only referring to the Reference Handbook when specific situations occur that are not fully covered in the Illustrated Rulebook.\n\nThis document is the Illustrated Rulebook, containing a streamlined version of the main rules needed for playing the game alongside art, miniature images and lore. In addition to this, you will need a few more documents to play a full game of T9A.\\\nArmy Books\nThe rules for the different armies are found in Army Books. Within these, you will find army composition rules, unit and model rules, characteristics, and so on.\n\nSupplements\nSupplements are optional add-ons to the game that require an agreement with the opponent before using.\n\n1821.6It is the tenth century of the Ninth Age. An Age of Peace, they say. An Age of Respite. An Age of Exploration and Rebuilding, following the many Ages of Ruin and the great Inferno.\n\nAnd yet everywhere, the shadow of war looms.\n\nThe peoples of the world have rebuilt, indeed: perhaps too far, with too much ambition.\n\nThey must contend with elder powers of elves and dwarves who have regained their former glory. With so-called barbarian tribes of ogres, orcs, goblins and beasts herds, who display a strength and hunger for battle like never before. With ancient necromantic dynasties reawoken, with renewed cabals of scheming Night Lords, with the devotees of Dark Gods flocking in ever-greater numbers, ushering otherworldly servants from beyond the Veil. With strange species of reptiles and rodents, long thought extinct, threatening a return to ancient empires of enslavement.\n\nAnd finally, they must contend with humanity itself, which has perhaps grown the most of all. Since the coming of the legendary hero Sunna, it has developed from primitive tribes into mighty nations whose will to conquer knows no bounds.\n\nIt is an Age of Promise. An Age of Possibility. An age where everything is to play for. Where any of the world’s powers could soon become master of all others. Where the world itself holds its breath. No longer an Age of Peace: it has become an Age of Battle."

The players need to put together their armies, prepare the Battlefield, select victory conditions and deploy their armies onto the Battlefield.\n\n2 -  Game Turns. The 9th Age is a turn-based game played over six Game Turns. Each Game Turn consists of two Player Turns. These are made up of a series of Phases:\n\n  •  Charge Phase\n\n  •  Movement Phase\n\n  •  Magic Phase\n\n  •  Shooting Phase\n\n  •  Rally Phase\n\n  •  Melee Phase\n\n3 -  After the Game.

Welcome\n\nActive & Reactive Player\n\nThe Active Player is the one currently taking their Player Turn, and the Reactive Player is the one whose Player Turn is not currently happening.\n\nFriendly and Enemy\nThe terms friendly and enemy are used to distinguish between units that belong to the same player (friendly units) and units controlled by opposing players (enemy units).\n\nYour First Game\n\nIs this your first game? Let’s get you started. First, prepare your battlefield: a large flat surface with model terrain on – a pile of books can be a hill, a mug can be a rock, a mouse pad can be a lake, and so on. Then, challenge a friend to a game where you both command your own miniature army.\n\nFor a trial run without the commitment of time and resources, we offer downloadable paper cutouts on the T9A website (Essence of War).\n\nIf you're uncertain about which army to choose, a brief overview of the 16 main armies and their primary themes can be found in the Introduction chapter.\n\n\t\nIf you're uncertain about which army to choose, a brief overview of the 16 main armies and their primary themes can be found in the Introduction chapter."

    "Description": "Before battle can be joined, you must establish the nature of the battlefield, the armies that will fight upon it, and their reason for being there. This is a natural part of setting up the game, but it can also represent a commander reviewing their troops and scouting the land in preparation for an important battle.\n\t\n\nWhen preparing to play a game of The 9th Age: Fantasy Battles, players follow a series of steps:\n\n\t1 -  Pregame planning (typically done before players arrive to the gaming table)\n\n  •  Army Size is decided, which determines the size of the game. This can be done by the players agreeing on an Army Size, or an outside source such as campaign rules or a tournament organiser dictating this.\n\n  •  Build an Army. Each player creates an Army Lists from one of the Armybooks.\n\n2 -   Initial preparations (these are sometimes done before arrival - typical in a tournament setting, and sometimes done by both players together - typical in more casual settings)\n\n  •  Build the Battlefield by setting up terrain and scenery to create an engaging and challenging environment for the battle.\n\n  •  Share Army Lists with your opponent, revealing the units and options you will be using during the game.\n\n  •  Select Victory Conditions. Normally this means picking Primary and Secondary Objectives, which define the goals for the coming battle.\n\n  •  Select Deployment Type. This defines how the armies will be placed on the Battlefield before the game begins.\n\n\t\n\t3 -  Battle setup (these actions are done at the gaming table by both players together)\n\n  •   Roll-off for Attacker and Defender. The players roll-off to see who will decide, which player is going to be the Defender, the other will be the Attacker.\n\n  •  Defender Decides Deployment Zones. These are the areas where each player's army will start the game.\n\n  •  Pregame Selections. Choices to make before Deployment are made at this step.  Common choices include choices for Secondary Objectives and Spell Swaps.\n\n  •  Deploy units. Players place their units, starting with the Attacker, within their designated Deployment Zones.\n\n  •  Move Vanguarding units. Units entirely with the model rule Vanguard perform their pre-game movement.\n\n\t\nSeason Packs are an annually updated supplement that can provide support in building a battlefield and add several variations on deployment types, Primary Objectives and Secondary Objectives. If you are looking for a fast and simple game, or this is one of your first games, we recommend you use the rules below and leave Season Packs for next time.\n\n/section{pregame_planning}/section{initial_preparations}/section{battle_setup}"

    "Description": "As the player, it is your duty to command your army on the battlefield, but first you will have to pick one of the different factions available to you. Each Army Book contains a description of the different units that are available to its faction, as well as their characteristics and special rules that apply to them.\n\nTo start building your army, you create an Army List, which includes the selection of units, spells and options you want to use along with their point costs. Every unit, weapon, upgrade, and Magic Item has a specific point cost, which is used to balance the game and ensure fair play between players.\n\n\tPlanning, strategy, knowing terrain, learning about the ponent – very useful for a heist! What? You were asking about battles? Oh yes, Klepa knows them too. We goblins are Warborn after all – that’s the name us and orc pals call ourselves together. Klepa has seen all the great battles, seen loads of action! Normally from quite far away – so you know I had a good view.\n\tMain thing I’ve learned is you’ve got to get there early if you want the best spot for hiding and picking over the loot at the end. You want some loot? Genuine, authentikarated battle gear, picked from the choiciest corpses! Just step quietly over to Appendicitis Numero Two and we’ll have a little chat about the low low prices.\n\t\n\nArmy Books\nThe rules for playing the various factions are detailed in Army Books and supplement Army Books (remember that using a supplement requires the agreement of your opponent or event organiser).\n\nUnit Entries\nEach entry in an Army Book is categorised into different Army Categories, each represented by specific icons in the unit entries of the Army Book. Each Army Category has its own points limit, as defined in the Army Book, determining how many points a player can allocate to that particular category. This allows players to create a balanced and strategic army composition for their games.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\ncharacterCharactersThis category typically allows players to spend up to 40% of the Army Size. All entries that belong to this Category follow the rules for Characters and Attachable Models.Characters are the leaders and exceptional individuals in the army, wielding various skills such as brute force, tactical acumen, spellcasting ability, or engineering knowledge. They play a crucial role in influencing the outcome of battles, and one of them usually  serves as the army's General, responsible for leading and inspiring your forces.\n\ncoreCoreThis Army Category always has a minimum amount of points that must be spent on it, usually 25% of the Army Size.\n\nCore units represent the most readily available warriors in the faction, serving as essential rank-and-file troops under the command of the Characters. They are always present in some combination as part of your fighting force.specialSpecialThis Army Category has no maximum or minimum limit. You are free to spend any amount of points on units in this Category.\n\nThe Special Army Category represents less common and more unique forces that are found in some but not all of your faction's armies. While they might make up the largest portion of your host, the availability of each unit is still limited. They generally fill a range of useful and impactful roles.\n\nEoSArmy-SpecificThis Army Category has a maximum amount of points that can be spent on it; the limit is defined within individual Army Books.\n\nArmy-Specific Categories introduce additional options and limitations in army building, reflecting the nature of the faction. Army-Specific Categories can include thematic groupings of units, limitations based on specific functions, and sometimes the faction’s most rare and powerful forces.\n\nBelonging to more than one Army Category\nSome units can be included in more than one Army Category, which is represented by more than one icon in their entry. In these cases, simply count the unit’s Point Cost towards the limits of all its Army Categories, but only once towards the army’s Point Cost.\n\nAdding Army Categories to a Unit\nChoosing certain options can make a unit count towards another Army Category in addition to its original Army Category. For example, giving a unit Shooting Weapons might make it also count towards the Ranged Support Army Category. This is marked by a small icon of the additional Army Category, displayed underneath the original Army Category icon(s), together with the conditions for counting towards this additional Army Category.\n\nSplitting Point Cost between Army Categories\nIn some rare cases, a unit’s Point Cost can be split between different Army Categories, where the Point Cost for some particular option is additionally counted towards a different Army Category than the unit. This is marked in the unit entry by a split icon, with the two halves representing the two Army Categories the unit counts towards.\n\nFor example, a 250 pts Elf Character, counted towards the Characters Army Category, decides to ride a 500 pts Dragon, which is an option marked to count additionally towards Beasts and Monsters. In this case, the player must count the entire unit’s Point Cost (250 + 500 = 750 pts) towards Characters, and the Dragon’s Point Cost (500 pts) towards “Beasts and Monsters”. Here too, of course, only 750 pts are added towards the army’s total limit.\n\nRarity - Restrictions for Units and Items\n\nCertain units and options in the army have limitations on how many times they can be included.\n\n\t\n  •  Maximum Points cost: Unless mentioned otherwise, no unit can have a points cost above 600 points.  A unit entry with a different maximum points cost different than this, follows its own defined limits instead. For example, a unit with (max. 800 pts) listed next to its unit size limits can cost up to 800 points.\n\n\t\n  •  Max. X Items per Army: Some items have an amount of Max. X allowed per army. For example, it might be Max. 2 Units, Max. 2 Models, or Max. 2 Mounts per Army. This means you can choose to include a maximum of X instances of these items in your army.\n\t\n  •  Regular: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 500 Army Points, rounding fractions up. For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 8 per Army. Unless noted otherwise, all units taken from Core are Regular.\n\t\n  •  Common: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 1000 Army Points, rounding fractions up. For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 4 per Army. Unless noted otherwise, all units taken from outside Core are Common.\n\t\n  •  Uncommon: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 1500 Army Points, rounding fractions up. For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 3 per Army.\n\t\n  •  Rare: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 2500 Army Points, rounding fractions up. For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 2 per Army.\n\t\n  •  Extraordinary: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 5000 Army Points, rounding fractions up. For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 1 per Army.\n\t\n  •  Legendary: These items can only be taken once per army.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  •  Max. X Combined Items per Army: Some combinations of items may be restricted in combination. In these cases this will be detailed in the Army Organisation part of the Army Book.\n\t\n  •  Max. X Items per Unit: Some items have a maximum limitation allowed per unit. This means you can choose to include up to X instances of these items for each unit.\n\t\n\n1.10orcKing.png\n\n/subsubsection{spell_selection}"

The Facing that corresponds to this Arc is the Target Facing. See Definitions and Terminology chapter for definitions of Arcs and Facings.\n\nA Charge Move is then resolved using a single Snaking Forward Move (see Movement Phase chapter for details), with an unlimited distance. During this move, the Charging Unit must move contact with its intended target - The Charging Unit’s Front Facing against the Target Facing.\n\nCharge Moves are allowed to end the move within 1\" of Impassable Terrain or other units, but are not allowed to move into contact with any enemy unit, other than the target of the Charge.\n\nOnce the Charging Unit touches its Target Facing, it performs an Align Move. This is done by picking up the Charging Unit and placing it back on the board aligned with the target unit, in a way that keeps the initial point of contact on the charged unit still in contact, while maximising the number of models in contact. See the Reference Handbook for details on how to prioritise the Align Move in complex situations.\n\nApply the rules below when performing Align Moves. The Charge Move must be made in such a way that the Charging Unit can satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n\n  •  The initial point of contact* on the target unit, before the Align Move, must remain in contact* after the Align Move. Note that the charging model that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact*.\n\n  •  If there is no single initial point of contact*, e.g. because the initial contact*is made along a line, the owner of the Charging Unit declares where the initial point of contact* is, among the possible points of initial contact*. This choice must be made such that the conditions below are satisfied as best as possible.\n\n  •  The Charging Unit is placed fully aligned with its Front Facing flush against the Target Facing.\n\n  •  If this is not possible, apply the rules for Unaligned Charges (see below).\n\n  •  The number of models in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\n\n  •  The number of models in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\n\nIf it is unavoidable to break one or more of the above conditions, prioritise maintaining the higher priority conditions, even if it means breaking a greater number of conditions in total. The Charging Unit must, if able to, perform its Charge Move so that the models involved in the initial contact* satisfies the conditions above as best as possible. As long as all the above conditions are satisfied to the best extent possible, the owner has the freedom to choose how to perform the Align Move.\n\nReferenceManualColorExample of a Charge Move. From left to right.1. Declare Charge: Unit A Declares a Charge towards unit B.\n2. Initial Forward: Unit A moves straight forward.\n3. Wheel: The unit is rotated forward around its front right corner.\n4. Concluding Forward: Unit A moves forward again, until it contacts unit B.\n5. Align: Unit A is picked up and put back down in contact and fully aligned with unit B.\n\nNow me and Fleabag, when we’re working a mark, our most reliable method is the old one-two.

The unit then moves forward as this single line.\n\n  •  Note that the model's still have a width (but no depth), equal to their base width, and note that this move can cause Dangerous Terrain Tests if used with a move type that triggers Dangerous Terrain Tests, such as March or Charge move.\n\n  •  When the unit reaches its unit's final position at the end of the Snaking Forward Move, the unit expands to regain its depth again. This is done by back parts of the unit moving straight back from the Front Facing until they reach their original position within the unit\n\nSnaking Forward MoveThe unit first performs an Initial Forward by moving straight forward.\nThe unit then Wheels by rotating forward around its right front corner.\nFinally, the unit performs a Concluding Forward move, where it moves straight forward again.\n\nSimplified Snaking Forward Move\\\nblank line\\\nWhen executing a Snaking Forward Move, you can quickly check possible moves by using a  measuring stick that has the same length as the width of the unit. Place this stick parallel with the unit’s Front Facing, then move the stick using the Snaking Forward Move rules. This stick represents the Front Facing of the unit.\n\n  •  If you are not happy with the end position, put this stick back at the Front Facing of the unit and try again.\n\n  •  Once you are happy with the position, leave the stick in its place and now move the unit to this position, aligning the Front Facing with measuring stick.\n\n      ReferenceManualColor\nA    ReferenceManualColor\nB \\      \nReferenceManualColorExample of Wheeling and PivotingA. Example of a Pivot. The unit is rotated around its centre. During this rotation, the unit is removed from the table, and then placed back facing a new direction. When measuring a Pivot, it's recommended that you start off by marking the centre of the unit. You can do this without moving the unit by placing four markers around it, such that they form a cross with its centre under the unit's centre. Then remove the unit and place it back, with its centre again on the centre of the marked cross.\n\nB. Example of a Wheel. The unit is rotated forward, around one of its front corners. The distance the unit is considered to have travelled is equal to the distance the unit’s outer front corner has moved in the straight forward direction, indicated by the red line in the figure. The example Wheel moved 4 inches. When measuring a Wheel, it's recommended to place a measuring stick next to the unit and aligned towards the unit's forward direction. Then wheel the unit to the wanted position, and then read off the distance from the measuring stick by checking how far the front corner moved, as indicated by the dotted line in the figure above."

It is also customary to mark the starting position, so that backtracking is possible to do accurately.\n\n\n\nReform Moves is where a unit tactically adjusts their arrangement on the field, granting them the strategic edge to adapt to new challenges during battle. This controlled shift is used to optimise positioning, formation and facing, white staying mostly in the same spot. \\\nAdvance Moves provide units with the freedom to manoeuvre on the battlefield, making it a versatile choice for repositioning when preparing to engage with the enemy.\\\nMarch Moves are the fastest but least flexible movement option available to a unit. It allows the unit to move quickly in a forward direction.\nValid Final Position\nFor the final position of the unit to be considered a valid position, regardless of which Move Manoeuvre was performed, the following condition must be met. If not, the Move Manoeuvre cannot be performed.\n\n  •  Each corner of the unit’s end position must be within twice its Mobility value (2xMob inches) of at least one corner’s starting position.

Measure the distance the centre travels, while making sure that no model moves further than its Mobility * 2, typically by measuring the distance of the models that have travelled the furthest.\\\n\nReferenceManualColorExample of Reform Move\n\nMid-Reform Move Actions\nIf, for any reasons, a model's position is relevant during a mid-Reform Move, such as during a Sweeping Attack or Dangerous Terrain Tests, the unit must be placed in a viable formation and following the Unit Spacing rule (0.5\") at the point where it becomes relevant, before continuing the move. If it cannot be placed, the move cannot be performed.

But sometimes stabbing people can be more hassle than it’s worth. You have to get up close, so there’s the unlovely risk of being stabbed right back.\nThat’s why lots of people prefer shooting – what we goblins call stabbing from a distance. Beautiful to see, really: all the ways people have invented for battling far off, nice and impersonal. Arrows are an easy one, but nowadays there’s guns too, all kinds. And big machines with springs for lobbing your classic rock, or spurting out fire, or sending off spells…\nSpeaking of spurting fire, some things don’t even need a machine. Dragons is a scary one. Thought they were miffy-logical til one showed up in Avras, bold as brass. Weird creatures, dragons. Love to collect stuff, but won’t haggle with merchants. Won’t let anyone near them except one special friend they call a rider. You almost never see two dragons together, but some say they have big secret meetings where no one can see.

    "Description": "Some say that battles are won or lost by preparation or sound strategies, but ultimately every fight will come down to the clash of weapons in close quarters. The Melee Phase is the time for your forces to put their mettle to the test, once they have met the enemy in Combat, and discover whether their strength – and a touch of divine fortune – can bring them the victory. And perhaps more important, whether the defeated side can continue to fight on. This is also when your leaders and champions will meet in single Combat with their counterparts, fighting great duels that will live in legend.\n\nDuring the Melee Phase, all Engaged units will attack each other. The Melee Phase is divided into smaller groups of combatants each called a Combat. Each Combat goes through a Round of Combat, one Combat after the next.\n\nGiants are a fascinating species, pseudo-symbiotic with other peoples, whose instinct for friendship has led them to become weapons of war throughout history. Some call this tragic, some call it noble.\n\nToday, with sixteen factions of growing strength locked in a delicate balance of power, certain bold, original, brilliant observers have hypothesised that perhaps it could be the trusting, suggestible giants that might tip the fragile equilibrium in favour of one group or another. You can find out more about this provocative, insightful idea in my latest three-volume masterwork, Giant By Name: How the World Underestimates Jotun Potential, available in all fine bookshops that stock self-published authors.\n\n0.93cyclop_kolata.jpgkolata\n\nThe Melee Phase is carried out using the following sequence:\\\n\tI & Enemy Wiped. If a unit's opponents have been removed outside the Melee Phase, the unit may perform a Post-Combat Pivot or an Overrun (if charging).\nII & Round of Combat. Each Combat is resolved in an order chosen by the Active Player. For each Combat, follow this sequence below:\n\n  •  Preparations for Combat\n\n  •  Remove Shaken units\n\n  •  Freeze Unit Boundaries\n\n  •  Combat Set-Up\n\n  •  Combat Formations\n\n  •  Static Combat Score\n\n  •  Choose Equipment and Abilities\n\n  •  Determine Agility Order\n\n\t\n\n  •  Perform Melee Attacks\n\n  •  Resolve Attacks\n\n  •  Determine the Winner\n\n  •  Casualty-based Combat Score\n\n  •  Final Combat Score\n\n  •  Take Break Test\n\n  •  Breaking and Pursuing\n\n  •  Determine who is Breaking or Pursuing\n\n  •  Unfreeze Unit Boundaries\n\n  •  Move Broken Units\n\n  •  Move Pursuing Units\n\n  •  Post Combat\n\n  •  Post-Combat Pivots\n\n  •  Combat Reforms\n\nIII & Repeat steps II for each group of interlocked Engaged units. Complete all actions in the Round of Combat Sequence for each unit in the chosen Combat before moving on to resolve the next Combat.\nIV & Once all Combats have been resolved, the Melee Phase ends.\n\t\nEnemy Wiped\nSometimes a unit that was previously Engaged in Combat had all its opponents removed before the start of the next Melee Phase. Such units follow the rules for No More Foes. If the unit has not moved since the enemy units were removed (e.g. with a Magical Move), it may perform a Post-Combat Pivot, or an Overrun if it is Charging.\n\nCombat\nEach Combat is fought between a group of units that are in direct base contact with each other. Normally, it involves two units facing off, but it can also include multiple units against a single enemy unit or a series of units linked together from both sides.\n\nThe Active Player chooses one such Combat to fight in a Round of Combat, meaning resolve all actions connected to a Round of Combat with all Engaged units. Then the Active Player chooses a new Combat that has not been fought in this Melee Phase, to fight a Round of Combat. Continue choosing and resolving Combats until all have been fought.\n\n\tFirst Round of Combat\n\tDuring the First Round of Combat, specific rules come into play. A unit's First Round of Combat occurs in two situations:\n\t\n\t\n  •  The First Round of Combat after successfully Charging an enemy unit.\n\t\n  •  The First Round of Combat after being successfully Charged by an enemy unit, provided it was not already Engaged in Combat.\n\t\n\n\t\n\tCombined Combats\n\tAny Combat that includes more than two units is called a Combined Combat.\n\n/section{preparation_for_combat}/section{combat_setup}/section{perform_melee_attacks}/section{determine_the_winner}/section{post_combat}"

In case of a tie, the attacker chooses which fraction to use.\n\nIn cases where a single attack or effect is multiplied into several hits, repeat the attack allocation step once it has been established how many hits are scored. At least one hit must still be allocated towards the original target. For example, you cast a spell that causes D6 hits, targeting an enemy unit.

Units that are Broken and about to flee, and units that are about to Pursue, are not nudged.\n\nMove units one at a time, in the order described below, until all units have either attempted to maintain contact and failed, or are now in contact with the enemy again.\n\n  •  Move Active Player's units first.\n\n  •  Move all units on each side, in the order that allows the most units to remain in Combat.\n\n  •  If equal, the owner decides the order of moving its units.\n\nMove the unit to maintain contact with the unit(s) they were in contact with before updating Unit Boundaries, following the rules below:\n\n  •  If the unit is in contact with an enemy already, it is not moved.\n\n  •  The unit cannot move through other units or Impassable Terrain.\n\n  •  The unit cannot move into contact with new enemy units, but they can end their move within 1\" of other units and Impassable Terrain.\n\n  •  Move the unit the minimum amount required to maintain contact.\n\n  •  Move the unit in straight lines, either directly forwards, backwards, sideways, or a combination of two of these directions.\n\n  •  Nudging cannot change the facing that is in contact with enemies.\n\nIf these movement rules do not allow the unit to maintain contact, do not move the unit at all. Units that lose contact follow the rules for No More Foes (see below).\n\nIf, as a result of updating Unit Boundaries, two or more separate groups of opposing units have been created, each such subgroup will be treated as a separate Combat from now on.\n\nNo More Foes\nWhen a unit is unable to be Nudged back into contact with enemies it previously was in contact with, including due to the unit no longer being on the Battlefield (e.g. due to being removed as a casualty outside the Round of Combat), such that it finds itself no longer Engaged in Combat, the unit may perform a Post-Combat Pivot, or if Charging, an Overrun."

Ignore other Pursuing units.\n\n  •  Which Arc the Pursuing unit is Located in for each enemy unit that may be Charged later in this process. If the Pursuit Move will lead to a Charge, it will be in the Facing determined at this point.\n\nThe Charging units will be moved first, in the order that best satisfies the Combined Charges rules (see Charge Phase chapter). Afterwards the remaining Pursuing units will be moved, in an order chosen by their owner.\n1. Pivot\nIf the unit is performing an Overrun, ignore this step; the unit always moves straight forward without Pivoting.\n\nThe Pursuing unit Pivots so that it is facing the same direction as the Pursued unit, or if  removed as a casualty, the direction the Pursued unit would have had, had it not been  removed as a casualty. Ignore the Unit Spacing rule during this Pivot.\n\nAfter the Pivot, one of the four situations below will arise. If more than one is applicable, apply the uppermost one.\n\n  •  Enemy unit: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit would be in contact with the Unit Boundary of an enemy unit that did not Flee from the same Combat, it declares a Charge against that unit, which can not perform any Charge Reactions.  If there is more than one possible target, the Pivoting unit chooses which unit to Charge.\n\nTo perform the Charge move, Remove the Pursuing unit from the Battlefield, and then place it back following the rules below:\n\n  •  It cannot change formation, \n\n  •  Its Front Facing is in contact with its target Facing determined before the Pivot, \n\n  •  The centre of the Pursuing unit moves as short a distance as possible from its position before the Pivot, while still allowing a legal position following the Unit Spacing Rule after the Align Move.\n\nAfterwards, perform the initial Align Move (see Charge Phase chapter). If there is not enough room to place the Pursuing unit in contact, treat the enemy unit as an Obstruction instead.\n\n  •  Table Edge: If the Front Facing of the unit is in contact with, or outside, the Table Edge, the unit performs a Post-Combat Pivot and then moves no further (i.e. ignore step 2. Forward Ahead). If it is not possible to perform this Post-Combat Pivot in a way that puts the unit in a legal end position, treat the Table Edge as an Obstruction instead.\n\n  •  Obstruction: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit would be in contact with an Obstruction, the unit instead Pivots so that it faces a direction as close as possible towards the same direction that the Pursued unit is facing, while following the Unit Spacing rule (normally this means stopping 1\" away from the Obstruction). The unit moves no further (i.e. ignore step 2. Forward Ahead).\n\n  •  Free to move: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit touches neither of the above, proceed to the 2. Forward Ahead step.\n\n2. Forward Ahead\nWithout moving the Pursuing unit, check what the first obstacle (Table Edge, Enemy Unit Boundary, or Obstruction) would be, within the rectangle formed by extending its Front Facing directly ahead of the unit a distance equal to the previously rolled Pursue Distance. If more than one is applicable, apply the uppermost one.\n\nThe Unit Spacing rule is ignored when doing this check and for all movement during Forward Ahead.\n\n  •  Enemy unit: If the first obstacle would be the Unit Boundary of an enemy unit that did not Flee from the same Combat, the Pursuing unit declares a Charge against that unit using its Pursuit Distance roll as its Charge Range. If there is more than one possible target, the Pursuing unit chooses which to Charge. The Charged unit may not perform any Charge Reactions.\n\nThe Pursuing unit immediately performs a Charge Move towards the previously determined Facing, following all the normal Charge Move and Align Move rules described in the Charge Phase chapter, (including Unaligned Charge and Blocked Path if applicable). If the Charge is not possible to complete, the unit does not perform a Failed Charge Move but treats the enemy unit as Obstruction instead, see below.\n\nIf the Pursuing unit joins a Combat that has already been fought or was created during this Melee Phase, it will be resolved in the next Melee Phase, with the Charging unit still counting as Charging. If the Pursuing unit joins a Combat that was not created during this Melee Phase and that has not been fought yet, the unit will have a chance to fight and Pursue again this phase.\n\n  •  Table Edge: If the first obstacle would be the Table Edge, move the unit straight forward until it touches the Table Edge, and then immediately perform a Post-Combat Pivot.\n\n  •  Obstruction : If the first obstacle would be an Obstruction, move the unit straight forward until just before it enters base contact with the Obstruction.\n\n  •  Free to move: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit touches neither of the above,  move the unit straight forward its Pursuit Distance.\n\n3. Legal Position?\nAt the end of the Pursue Move, check if the unit is in a legal position following the Unit Spacing rule. It cannot be in contact with an enemy unit it did not declare a Charge against, but can be within 0.5\" of units and Impassable Terrain , this  includes friendly units that were part of the same Combat. If the unit is not in a legal position, at the end of the move, backtrack the move to the unit's last legal position where it follows the Unit Spacing rule.\n\nExample of two units\nPursuing into the same enemy unit.a) Unit D loses the Combat, Breaks, and Flees 7\". The owner of the winning units chooses to roll for unit A’s Pursuit Distance first. 6\" is not enough to catch the Fleeing unit. Unit B’s Pursuit Distance is 7\", so it is equal to or higher than unit D’s Flee Distance: the Fleeing unit is immediately  removed as a casualty. Unit C's Pursuit Distance is 5\".\\\\\nb) When checking which units will Charge an enemy unit during their Pursuit, before moving any Pursuing unit, it turns out that both unit A and unit B will Charge unit E, so both units declare a Charge against unit E. Unit C will not Charge any enemy units. \\\\\nc) Now units A and B perform their Pursuit Moves first. During this move, they can move through one another ignoring the Unit Spacing rule. Otherwise, they move using the normal rules for Charge Moves (one Wheel allowed, Maximising Contact). In order to maximise the number of models and units in base contact, unit A aligns its Front Facing with unit E’s, while unit B moves into corner to corner contact with unit E. Afterwards unit C Pivots and moves its Pursuit Distance straight forward."

Players always share a total of 20 Battle Points, making a 10-10 a draw and a 20-0 a decisive victory. Battle Points can be scored in three ways:\n\n  •  Victory Points: The primary way to score Battle Points is by defeating enemy Units, which give you Victory Points (VP). See below for details on how many VP units give.\n\n  •  Winning the Primary Objective: Each player competes for the same Primary Objective, selected at the start of the game. The player who wins the Primary Objective scores 3 Battle Points, and the other player loses 3 Battle Points.\n\n  •\n\n  •  Completing Secondary Objectives:: Each player usually has one Secondary Objective, selected at the start of the game.\n\nFor each Secondary Objective a player completes, they score 1 Battle Point, and their opponent loses 1 Battle Point. E.g. if each player completes an equal number of Secondary Objectives, the score does not change.\n\nIf no outside source tells you how to use Secondary Objectives (e.g. tournament organiser, campaign rule, etc.), players should establish how much they want to focus on Secondary Objectives before the game. Consider the following guidelines:\n\n  •  In standard competitive games, Secondary Objectives are typically worth +1/-1 BP, as detailed in the table below.\n\n  •  For games focused on learning the core rules, it is recommended to ignore Secondary Objectives entirely.\n\n  •  Those seeking a more immersive, story-driven experience may opt to assign Secondary Objectives a higher value, such as +5/-5 BP.\n\nPlayers are encouraged to assign a value for Secondary Objectives that aligns with their desired level of competitive challenge and narrative engagement.\n\n\t\n\nScoring Victory Points\n\nAt the end of the game, each player earns Victory Points (VP) using the rules below.\n\n  •  Destroyed Units: You obtain VP equal to the full Point Cost (from the Armylist) of each enemy Unit that has been removed as a casualty.\n\n  •  Shaken Units: You obtain VP equal to half its Point Cost, rounding fractions up, for each enemy Unit that is Shaken at the end of the game.\n\n  •  Decimated Units: You obtain VP equal to half the Point Cost, rounding fractions up, for each enemy Unit that is Decimated at the end of the game.\n\n  •  Shaken and Decimated Units: You earn VP equal to the full Point Cost for each enemy Unit that is both Shaken and Decimated at the end of the game.\n\n  •\n\nWhen calculating VP, Attachable Models are considered separately from the Units they are joined to at the end of the game.\n\nAfter summing all Victory Points for both players, calculate the difference in Victory Point between the players.

At this scale, you may envision an inch representing roughly 1.5 metres in real life. In this case, a longbow’s 30\" range translates to 45 metres.\nYou can also draw inspiration from history, seeing 1\" as 10 metres instead This gives the longbow a range of 300 metres, and a standard battlefield of 72×48\" table would then represent a real life area of 720×480m, or roughly 50 football pitches. In medieval times, this would represent a battlefield where two forces with soldiers numbering from a few hundred to several thousand could meet.\n\t\nThe rules often refer to things being within a certain distance. When measuring distances, the closest points between objects are used, even if there are intervening elements. Models or units are considered within range if the distance between their closest points is less than or equal to the given range. Measurements are taken from and to the Unit Boundary of a unit, and players are free to measure any distances at any time.\n\nRange\nSome effects, for example spells or shooting weapons, have a range value (X). This means that the effect can target things up to X inches away on the battlefield. Models or units are considered to be within range if the distance between their closest points is less than or equal to the given range.\n\nLong Range\nFor shooting weapons, we define targets as being in Long Range if they are further away than half of the weapon's range (but still within the maximum range).\n\nlineskip\n1214.4The 9th Age at Different Scales\n\nlineskip\n\nThis game is designed to be compatible with changes in scale. The most common way to use this alternative mode of play is to play it at half-scale, where all distances are halved. This opens up possibilities for gameplay in more confined spaces, such as  on ordinary kitchen tables, and the entire armies can be neatly stored away in shoe boxes.\n\n  •  Distances: Halve all measurements. This includes, but is not limited to, the battlefield dimensions, weapon and spell ranges, Mobility and Charge values, base sizes, area of effects, and more.\n\n  •  Models: Use smaller models designed to fit on the half base size. Typically, models suitable for this scale are in the 10mm range.\n\n  •  Custom Measuring Devices:  It’s recommended that custom-made measuring devices are used, where all measurements are pre-halved. Such tools simplify rule referencing, eliminating the need for mental recalibration."

Most warriors combine to form disciplined regiments called units, and several such units form the  foundation of your army.\n\nModel A single gaming piece placed on a base. Each model has its own profile, which consists of a statline of values, model rules, and equipment. The profile reflects the capabilities of the model.\n\nRank-and-File model Normal models in a unit. All models, except Attachable Models (such as all Characters), are referred to as Rank-and-File models.\n\nBase The platform on which a playing piece rests. Bases are rectangular and represent the area of the battlefield occupied by the model. In the game rules, the base is the only physical aspect of the model that matters. Bases are measured in front-width × side-length, e.g., 25×50 mm for most horse riders.\n\nUnit A group of one or more models that operate as a single entity, arranged in a rectangular formation. Models in a unit move and fight together, coordinating their actions on the battlefield.\n\nWhen forming a unit of multiple models, the following conditions must be met to form a viable formation;\n\n  •  The models are placed in a tight rectangular formation and facing the same direction.\n\n  •  The unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank.\n\n  •  For units that are always considered to have 0 Proper Ranks, such as units entirely with Light Troops, apply this rule as if they could form Proper Ranks (e.g. a Height 1 units entirely with Light Troop cannot have more ranks than files unless at least 5 models wide).\n\n  •  Note that joining a unit with a Character is considered a voluntary action.\n\n  •  The models are perfectly aligned and in contact with each other.\n\n  •  The width of the unit is determined by the first frontmost rank. No models may extend past this width.\n\n  •  Models not in the first rank must be positioned so that another model is directly in front of them, ensuring the entire front edge of their bases are in contact with the models in front of them.\n\n  •  All ranks within a unit must have the same width, except for the rear rank, which can be narrower.\n\n  •  It is acceptable for the rear rank to have gaps, as long as the models are aligned with those in the other ranks.\n\n  •  An Incomplete Rank refers to a rank with one or more missing models.\n\nWhen a rule, ability, spell, or any other effect affects a unit, all models of the unit are affected, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nUnit Boundary The Unit Boundary is an imaginary rectangle encompassing the outer edges of a unit. Unit cannot be inside another Unit Boundary, unless the units are explicitly allowed to temporarily be overlapping.\n\nThe Centre of a unit A unit's centre is located at the centre of its Unit Boundary.\n\nFacings A unit or a model has four Facings that correspond to the edges of the Unit Boundary or the model's base; a Front, a Rear, and two Flanks.\n\nArcs A unit's Arcs correspond to the area in front of the four Facings, divided by a straight line extending from the corners of the Unit Boundary at a 135° angle from the unit's Facings.\n\n\\\n\nUnit Arcs, Unit Facings, and Unit Boundariesa) This unit has 3 ranks and 5 files.  The rear rank is incomplete and only contains 4 models. The Front, Flank, and Rear Arcs are defined by drawing lines from the corners of the Unit Boundary at a 135  angle from the unit’s Facings.\\\nb) The Unit Boundary is the area drawn around the outer edges of the unit, shaded red lines. The Centre of the unit is the centre of the Unit Boundary. \\\nc) A Unit Boundary cannot be inside another Unit Boundary, not even with parts that are not occupied by any models.\n\nProper Ranks The number of models required to form a Proper Rank depends on the unit's Height:\n\n  •  5 models for Height 0-2, \n\n  •  3 models for Height 3-4, and\n\n  •  1 model for Height 5.\n\nRanks and Files Lines of models in the same unit that are side by side are called ranks, and lines of models that are directly in front and behind each other are called files.\n\nModel Parts Some models have multiple lines of Offensive Profiles. Each line represents a different Model Part.\n\nFor example, a Cavalry model consists of a rider and its mount. If a rule, ability, spell, or effect affects a model, all model parts are affected unless stated otherwise.

For each roll of ‘X+’, the unit suffers a hit that wounds automatically with AP 10.\n\nThe number of Dangerous Terrain Tests a unit must roll is equal to half the number of models in the unit, rounding fractions up, and multiplied by the models’ Height.

The Steel Road runs parallel to the Silk Road to the north, with access controlled by the Ogre Khans. It leads from the Blasted Plains through the Sky Mountains, across the northern part of the human region of Sagarikadesha, finishing its rich path in the glorious land of Tsuandan, where the Dragon Emperor rules over men.\nSet sail south from Bellatorre, and in three nights you will reach the docks of Port Reynaud, Equitaine’s holdfast in Taphria. Should you dare it, you will never forget the nights spent in the Great Desert, for they are terrible and fascinating all at once. There, following the path of the Napaat river, lie the remains of a truly ancient kingdom with its legends of never-dying monstrosities. In the west stand the fortresses and souks of Qassar, full of exotic smells and tales of evil spirits, the djinn. In the west and southeast of the continent lie vast kingdoms of men; the Koghi Empire and Kingdom of Vanhu respectively. Finally in its south, the forests around the Mfumu river are said to hide some of the most ancient secrets of the world.\nThe Great Ocean divides Vetia from the two western continents, Silexia in the north and Virentia in the south. The Ocean itself is the dominion of elves: there the fleets of the two great nations, the Highborn and their dreaded kin, vie for supremacy. Here lies the main motherland of the Highborn Elves, the proud islands of Celeda Ablan, and Silexia where freedom is a commodity to be traded.\nOn the eastern coast of Virentia mankind too, has established colonies: the imperial city of Fredericksberg, and the port of Aguadulce, of Destria. Beyond them, a lush forest of wonderful colors and inconceivable dan- gers hides the secrets of ancient civilizations. Dividing Virentia from Silexia, the Shattered Sea; a rumoured maelstrom of magic and tempests, from which no vessel returns.\n\n--From A New Atlas for the Ninth Age, by Johannes Strabo"

However, the move cannot end overlapping other units or Impassable Terrain, continue the move in a straight line until the unit can be placed on the battlefield without overlapping obstructions. Remember that the unit ignores the Unit Spacing rule, which means it can be placed within 1\" of other units or Impassable Terrain.\n\n  •  If the obstruction  encountered was a friendly unit, this unit must take a Panic Test.\n\n  •  If the obstruction  encountered at any point of the move was an enemy unit or Impassable Terrain, treat these as Dangerous Terrain (4+)(note that enemy units that declared a Charge against the Fleeing unit is handled differently, see below).\n\n5 -  If the Flee Move takes the unit into contact with the Table Edge, or an enemy unit that has declared a Charge against the Fleeing unit in this phase, the unit is removed as a casualty."
